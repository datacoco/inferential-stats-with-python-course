# inferential-stats-with-python-course

This is my python code with instructions.

This is my first statistics for python quiz where at first I thought I would fail. After giving it some effort I acheived 100 percent on the quiz. 
I felt I knew what I was doing. It took several tries to manipulate the data to get it ready for the stats code.
